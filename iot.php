			<h1>Internet Of Things</h1>
			<p>The internet of today has become an exciting and indispensable platform of communication for people and business. It touches every aspect of humanity today. People use the internet, and internet connected devices dozens,
			if not hundreds of times each day. From making online purchases, sending and reading text messages, checking e-mails, to engaging in their favorite social media sites, the list goes on and on. But now, a new technological
			revolution is taking place, that promises to make the evolution of the internet to this point insignificant by comparison. It's called the Internet of Things.</p>

			<p>The Internet Of Things, combined with the IPV6 protocol, will allow every object on Earth to have it's own unique identifier, and communicate with other objects, and web servers, using the internet. One can only imagine
			the possibilities. Currently, Cisco estimates there are 9 billion devices that connect to the internet. The information technology research company Gartner estimates that by the year 2020, this number will reach 30 billion
			internet connected devices.</p>

			<p>Every great advancement starts with an idea. At KerBob Interactive Web Solutions, we have the experience and ability to turn your idea into reality. Using the devices and technologies below, we can work with you
			to turn your idea into a living, breathing, internet connected solution, with real world applications.</p>

			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<h2>Sensors</h2>
			<p><img src="img/sensors.jpg" style="float: right; width:20%;margin:0 15px 15px 15px;">
			One of the key components of any system are the sensors. If it moves, beats, changes temperature or some other state or characteristic, sensors are what will generate data related to that change, and send it to a listening
			microcontroller for processing. One of the more exciting advances in sensor technology are accelerometers. These low cost devices can accurately measure object orientation, acceleration and movement in any direction. There
			are literally thousands of low cost sensor solutions available on the market today, with more new ones being introduced every day. We have the ability to interpret sensor data, and process it in meaningful ways that are
			important to your application. We can work with sensors you have already selected, or we can help you find sensors that are just right for your needs.</p>

			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<h2>Microcontrollers</h2>
			<p><img src="img/microcontroller.jpeg" style="float: left;width:20%;margin:0 15px 15px 15px;">
			Microcontrollers are the brains of all smart devices. Acting on data received from sensors, microcontrollers apply pre-programmed logic to the sensor data received, and take different actions, based on different conditions.
			Mixed signal microprocesors can accept both digital and analog data from sensors, and process both accordingly. Microcontroller technology has gotten so affordable that any object can be embedded with a microprocessor 'brain'
			for only a few dollars. Their low power consumption makes them ideal for embedding into battery operated devices. We can program and incorporate any one of the wide range of microprocesors available today into your application,
			and use it not only to report sensor data, but also to receive commands and instructions from a web interface, or another device, based on certain conditions.</p>

			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<h2>Protocols</h2>
			<p><img src="img/rs232.jpg" style="float: right;width:20%;margin:0 15px 15px 15px;">
			A device protocol is a 'language' of communication. Just as two people agree that they are going to have a conversation in 'English', over some other widely accepted language, devices too have a number of different
			protocols, or 'languages' that they can agree to speak to eachother in. There are many established communication protocols in existence today. Among them are RS-232, SPI, and I2C. The type of microprocessor used will
			determine which protocol is used. Any kind of data can be transmitted between microprocessors using one of the existing protocols. Or, if your application requires it, we can work with you to design and implement a new
			protocol specific to your application.</p>

			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<h2>TCP/IP Converters</h2>
			<p><img src="img/wiznet.jpg" style="float: left;width:20%;margin:0 15px 15px 15px;">
			Converters take microcontroller data, supplied in one of the protocols mentioned above, package it into TCP/IP 'envelopes', and send it out over the internet. These devices have standard RJ-45 ethernet connectors, and connect
			directly to internet routers. This connection gives the data from devices access to the World Wide Web. Device data can then be sent anywhere. Also, internet connected devices can receive data too. This allows devices to be controlled
			from anywhere, using the World Wide Web. Imagine being able to control everything in your life from your smartphone or other mobile, internet connected device. The combination of technology required to make this a reality
			exists today. Let us make it work for you!

			<h2>Web Interfaces</h2>
			<p><img src="img/panel.png" style="float: right;width:20%;margin:0 15px 15px 15px;">
			<p>At KerBob, we are web developers too. After all of your devices are connecting to eachother, and a web server, we can design a custom control panel to manage all of them. Our development team utilizes state of the art web
			technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and Python. If you have an existing WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal CMS, we can write plug-ins to integrate all of your hardware activity and business logic into your existing
			platform. We are database specialists too. We can design and implement data solutions for you using MS SQL, MySQL, Postgress, and Mongo database architectures. Using a centrally located web server, we can also program your interface
			to generate and send SMS text messages and e-mail alerts whenever something exciting happens.</p>

			<div class="clearfix"></div>
			<h2>Device Interaction and Control</h2>
			<p><img src="img/control.jpg" style="float: left;width:20%;margin:0 15px 15px 15px;">
			<p>Devices today not only have the ability to transmit and send valuable and relevant data, but they can receive data back too. The data transmitted and received by devices could be in the form of instructions and commands.
			Devices can be programmed to automatically act on certain conditions, and they can be programmed to act on instructions sent from a user at the web interface. With a mobile, internet connected device, devices can now be
			control anywhere, at any time. </p>
